## Data Science Academic Projects

This is a collection of small projects I have worked on during my time in a data science program. Currently, they include:
* A sampling of a database project in which a classmate and I designed, implemented, and queried a relational database using Oracle SQL.
* A statistical modeling project in which I used SAS to characterize data extracted from a dataset on Alzheimer's disease death rates through the application of a variety of statistical tests and simple linear regression.
* A statistical modeling project in which I used SAS on the Alzheimer's disease death rate dataset to detect outliers, check for normality, construct a multiple linear regression model, test for lack of fit, and provide confidence intervals.
* An exploratory data analysis project in which I use the pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and sciplot libraries to perform numerical and visual analysis of a dataset containing medical insurance costs and demographics of individuals from the U.S.
